    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />

    Even though the book is primarily created for TOEFL preparation, it forms an
    excellent foundation for any advanced-level English exam, including the SAT.
    Roughly said, this book helps you take your English from level B2 to solid
    B2+. Concerning both English and math, we generally advise you first to
    improve your theoretical knowledge and then start working on the test
    exercises - your practice will yield much more effective results with a
    stronger foundation. Therefore, try to work on this book at the beginning of
    the preparation process. The rich vocabulary thus gained will be very
    helpful for the Reading Section of the SAT, which is flooded with complex
    words that are often unfamiliar to a non-native speaker. If you take most of
    this book, you will be able to understand reading passages well; however,
    400 Must-Have Words for TOEFL represents the second foundational book in our
    vocabulary series. In order to maximize your scores, consider working on 504
    Absolutely Essential Words, 1100 Words You Need to Know, etc.
