    <strong>General description:</strong><br />
    This book presents the essential core of words that students at
    middle-school and higher levels must know and be able to use fluently for
    academic success. These words also constitute essential vocabulary for ESL
    students and test-takers, as well as others who speak English as their
    second language. The authors present a series of brief word-building
    lessons, each introducing 12 new words that are presented in sample
    sentences and short articles. Fill-in-the-blanks exercises help students
    measure their word-building progress. Informed with clear yet simple
    definitions and examples, readers will find their vocabulary has improved
    dramatically.

    504 Absolutely Essential Words helps you to broaden your vocabulary, which
    is essential for succeeding in the Reading Section of the SAT. Roughly said,
    this book will help you take your English from level B2 to solid B2+;
    however, in order to guarantee this result, we recommend complementing it
    with 400 Must-Have Words for TOEFL. These two books importantly overlap, but
    both contain different things worth considering from time to time. If you
    take 400 Must-Have Words for TOEFL first and then continue with 1100 Words
    You Need to Know, you can omit 504 Absolutely Essential Words in case of
    limited time. But if you have a chance, do spend time on this book - it will
    ensure a smooth transition from upper-intermediate to advanced vocabulary.
    Concerning both English and math, we generally advise you first to improve
    your theoretical knowledge and then start working on the test exercises -
    your practice will yield much more effective results with a stronger
    foundation. Therefore, try to work on this book at the beginning of the
    preparation process.
