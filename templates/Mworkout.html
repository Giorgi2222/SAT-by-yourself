    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    Math Workout for the SAT is a book from one of the most popular publishers -
    The Princeton Review - and is comparable to Barron's Math Workbook for the
    New SAT. This book is a section-specific guide for math. It includes clear
    instructions about every mathematical topic tested by SAT and provides
    plenty of exercises to help you boost your score. If you are thinking of
    taking College Panda’s SAT Math, we highly recommend that you practice the
    strategies you learned from it in this workbook too. In this case, you will
    ignore all the techniques and other descriptions provided here. If you have
    very limited time, concentrate on College Panda’s SAT Math and don’t spend
    time on this book. However, be aware that using this workbook will help you
    a lot because College Panda’s Math focuses only on the harder problems of
    the test, and thus you may miss some easier topics that you might be unsure
    of.
