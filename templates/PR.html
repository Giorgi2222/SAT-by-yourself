    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    The Princeton Review SAT Premium Prep is a typical general prep book. It
    includes the descriptions, strategies, and exercises for every section of
    the exam. Even though it’s very convenient, the reason why we don’t focus on
    this type of books is that they are not as comprehensive and deep as the
    books for specific sections. We prefer to use general prep books as a source
    of practice tests. We recommend the Princeton Review because it has
    high-quality practice tests, quite similar to the actual SAT. Some say that
    they are a bit easier than the real SAT; however, even if that’s true, they
    are still very useful for practice. If you have a chance to work with the
    section-specific books, don’t waste your time reading the strategies or
    doing exercises from this book. Use only the full practice tests from time
    to time in order to observe your progress and get used to the structure.
    However, if you have very limited time, focus only on this book instead of
    section-specific guides to be quicker. Be aware that preparing only with
    this book surely won’t yield as good results as the section-specific guides.
