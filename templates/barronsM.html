    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />

    Math Workbook for the New SAT is a book from one of the most popular
    publishers - Barron’s - and is comparable to Math Workout for the SAT from
    The Princeton Review. This book is a section-specific guide for math. It
    includes clear instructions about every mathematical topic tested by SAT and
    provides plenty of exercises to help you boost your score. If you are
    thinking of taking College Panda’s SAT Math, we highly recommend that you
    practice the strategies you learned from it in this workbook too. In this
    case, you will ignore all the techniques and other descriptions provided
    here. If you have very limited time, concentrate on College Panda’s SAT Math
    and don’t spend time on this book. However, be aware that using this
    workbook will help you a lot because College Panda’s Math focuses only on
    the harder problems of the test, and thus you may miss some easier topics
    that you might be unsure of.
