    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    English Vocabulary in Use Upper-Intermediate helps you broaden your
    vocabulary and is useful for any English-language exam. In order to do well
    on an academically high-level test like SAT, it is necessary for a
    test-taker to have a rich vocabulary. This book helps to prepare the
    foundation for the complex diction of the SAT. Roughly said, it can take
    your English level from B1/B1+ to B2. This is the first book in our
    vocabulary series; therefore, you should continue developing your word
    skills with 400 Must-Have Words for TOEFL or 504 Absolutely Essential Words
    at least. Otherwise, only this book wonâ€™t guarantee your proper
    understanding of the SAT reading passages. Concerning both English and math,
    we generally advise you first to improve your theoretical knowledge and then
    start working on the test exercises - your practice will yield much more
    effective results with a stronger foundation. Therefore, try to work on this
    book at the beginning of the preparation process.
