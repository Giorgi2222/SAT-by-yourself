    <strong>General description:</strong><br />
    The Official SAT Study Guide includes eight official SAT(R) practice tests -
    all of them created by the test maker. As part of the College Board's
    commitment to transparency, all practice tests are available on the College
    Board's website, but The Official SAT Study Guide is the only place to find
    them in print along with over 250 pages of additional instruction, guidance,
    and test information.<br />

    With guidance and practice problems that reflect the most recent
    information, this edition takes the best-selling SAT guide and makes it even
    more relevant and useful. Be ready for the SAT with strategies and
    up-to-date information straight from the exam writers.<br />

    The Official SAT Study Guide will help students get ready for the SAT
    with:<br />
    - 8 official SAT practice tests, written in the exact same process and by
    the same team of authors as the actual exam<br />
    - detailed descriptions of the math and evidenced based reading and writing
    sections<br />
    - targeted practice questions for each SAT question type<br />
    - seamless integration with Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy.

    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    his Collegeboard book provides the 8 Official SAT Full Practice Tests and
    some test-taking strategies. All the official practice tests are also
    accessible on the Collegeboard website; you can print them out and write
    them. In terms of strategies, we have worked with this book, and it’s not
    very helpful. It only provides descriptions of the tasks, not any useful
    advice about handling them. Therefore, don’t get the Official Guide, just
    print out the tests. (In our list, we included it as a book just for our
    technical convenience.) As for the official practice tests in general, don’t
    waste them at the beginning of the preparation process. Start with
    unofficial practice tests and once you get better with your vocabulary,
    grammar, and math, then start taking the official ones. Always spread the
    practice tests out. There’s no point in taking all the tests at once. The
    tests should help you to see your progress; therefore, create a schedule and
    write them every once in a while. Don’t forget to analyze your answers very
    carefully and learn the concepts you made mistakes on.<br />
    <br />
    Note: The Collegeboard partners with Khan Academy, enabling you to access
    some official practice materials for free. At Khan Academy, you can create
    your schedule for official practice tests and if you write them online, you
    can get personalized feedback, practice strategies, and exercises.
