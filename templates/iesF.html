    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    There are lots of SAT practice tests out there, but a majority of them don’t
    reflect the style of the actual exam. We have gathered some of the best
    currently available. Generally, think of practice tests as tools for
    estimating your improvement and updating your work plan. Plenty of books we
    provided can serve as workbooks for different sections, skill sets, etc.,
    but use practice tests from time to time in order to understand how your
    strengths and weaknesses evolved and what you have to work on. Always spread
    the practice tests out. There’s no point in taking all the tests at once.
    The tests should help you to see your progress; therefore, create a schedule
    and write them every once in a while. One more important detail is the
    timing. SAT is one of the most ruthlessly timed exams. Learning how to pace
    yourself properly is one of the most important skills; therefore, always use
    a timer when you write the practice tests. Don’t worry, you probably won’t
    be able to write everything within the allocated time at first. Don’t leave
    the questions unanswered or texts unread because of that. Write your first
    test with a stopwatch - see how long it takes you. But starting from the
    second one, time your practice tests and try to get quicker on each of them.
    Getting closer to your test date, write the practice tests more and more
    frequently. And most importantly, don’t forget to analyze your answers very
    carefully and learn the concepts you made mistakes on. <br />
    <br />
    Note: If you have very limited time, focus only on practice tests. Analyze
    your results and try to learn the concepts you don’t know. The easiest way
    to boost your score is to learn grammar and math concepts.
