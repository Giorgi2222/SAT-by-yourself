    The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar is a book by a remarkable author. Erica
    Meltzer is an experienced SAT tutor; all her books are amazingly efficient.
    This book focuses on the grammar needed specifically for the SAT and apart
    from theory, introduces you to the real questions from SAT tests. If you
    have limited time, we recommend starting prep with Ultimate Guide to SAT
    Grammar and complementing it with the Blue Book whenever you discover any
    grammatical topics that you are not good at. This book offers you various
    strategies for approaching the SAT tests; therefore, while working on it,
    make sure you do Writing Section practice tests too in order to employ the
    techniques you learned and determine which ones work for you.
