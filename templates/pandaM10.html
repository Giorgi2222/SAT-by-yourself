    format and question types on the new SAT, unlike most other books that were
    rushed to publication. It contains:<br />
    - 10 Complete SAT Math Practice Tests<br />
    - Answer Explanations for all Questions<br />
    - An index of questions grouped by category so you can focus on the topics
    you struggle on<br />
    - The Perfect Companion to The College Panda's SAT Math: The Advanced Guide
    and Workbook<br />

    <strong>Our experience:</strong><br />
    The College Panda's 10 Practice Tests for the SAT Math provides full-length,
    structurally very high-quality tests only for the math section of the SAT.
    It is a fantastic resource helping you to use your newly acquired skills and
    knowledge in practice. The practice tests provided are very similar to the
    real structure and style of SAT; therefore, they can help you work on your
    pacing. SAT is one of the most ruthlessly timed exams, and developing pacing
    skills is crucial for success. We provided some full test options, and they
    will help your timing too, but we recommend that you still complete these
    tests. This book represents complementary to The College Panda's SAT Math;
    therefore, when you write the tests and see your mistakes, apart from
    reading the detailed answer explanations, you can go to the attached chapter
    of The College Panda's SAT Math and learn what you donâ€™t know. Trust us,
    this is very convenient and effective.
