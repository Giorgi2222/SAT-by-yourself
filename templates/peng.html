    The Penguin Guide to Punctuation is a valuable resource for improving your
    editing skills. The writing and Language Section of the SAT places an
    enormous emphasis on correct punctuation; therefore, spending time on this
    kind of books is a good investment. However, the Penguin Guide provides
    extremely detailed instructions about English grammar, and if you donâ€™t aim
    to take 750+ on SAT English Section, you may want to reconsider spending
    time on this book. Before thinking about the Penguin Guide, you should
    definitely complete Blue Book and do a lot of Writing Section practice
    tests. If you see that you still need to improve your punctuation, this book
    will help you a lot.
